Warning! Do not use if you are not on the 'braun' branch of the sage-on-gentoo overlay.
By default you should be on the master branch.
The 'vbraun' branch is 
 * work in progress not yet deemed ready for general use
 * the sage* 9999 uses git snapshot of sage's release manager (Volker Braun).

This is the git repo where PR are merged in between develop release. 
Patches may be different from the master branch and at times broken because of PR that may end up unmerged.
